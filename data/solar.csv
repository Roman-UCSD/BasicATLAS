# Standard (nearly-solar) abundances of elements in stars
#
# Abundances are defined following the standard astronomical convention:
#     "abundance of A" = log10("Number density of A"/"Number density of H") + 12.00
#
# Sources:
#    0: No abundance available (abunance set to -99.99,-99.99 by default)
#    1: The hydrogen abundance is 12.00 by definition
#    2: Helium abundance in a protostar using the standard solar model from Christensen-Dalsgaard 1998 (1998SSRv...85...19C)
#    3: Present day spectroscopic photospheric abundances from Asplund+2009 (2009ARA&A..47..481A), table I
#    4: Meteoritic abundances from Asplund+2009 (2009ARA&A..47..481A), table I
#    5: Present day indirect photospheric abundances from Asplund+2009 (2009ARA&A..47..481A), table I (see section 3.6 for details)
#    6: Present day spectroscopic photospheric abundances from Caffau+2011 (2011SoPh..268..255C), table V (using CO5BOLD 3D model of the solar atmosphere)
#    7: Present day spectroscopic photospheric abundance of zirconium from Caffau+2011 (2011AN....332..128C)
#    8: Present day spectroscopic photospheric abundance of neon from Takeda+2010 (2010PASJ...62.1239T) based on a sample of B-stars
